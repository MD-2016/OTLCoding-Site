# OTLCoding-Site
A site used a big project for a capstone to earn my Associates Degree. The goal was to create a site that allowed users to make an account and choose code challenges based on given selection of languages. The original idea for this site was to be updated daily with new coding challenges. This site was built with PHP, JQuery, phpmyadmin, MySQL, CSS, PHPBB3, and HTML5.

PHPBB3 is omitted due to being too large. The only purpose it served as allowing users to post solutions and comment on each other's work based on the chosen language.
